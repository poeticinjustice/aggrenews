**User Stories**

_Primary User (update)_

- A guest should be able to log into the page and see an image of an example of what a user's page can look like
- It should then be obvious how to create an account, and that they, obviously, should
- Users would automatically be loggged into their accounts once an account has been created, and they would have the option to log in and log out.
- Once a user is logged in, they should be able to select from a number of news sources and add them to their account (ideally, they would be able to preview sources their sources in a modal to see recent articles before adding)
- Those sources would then be populated 


_ME_

I've signed up for and received API keys from the Gaurdian and NYT. I also received a developer token from feedly. Ultimately, I want to make a news aggregator. I've always wanted to make a news aggregator. I'm now going to make my own news aggregator because I deserve it. It won't be anywhere near what feedly can do, but whatever. I'm going to be a user who can customize my own news feed and this is my user story. 

_Another crappy user_

Hi, I'm another user, and I want to tell a story too. I love feedly, but sometimes, I want to add feeds that feedly doesn't access, and I want to have more specific controls over certain feeds. I've heard this dude can do that for me. He got a developer token from feedly, so he can use their API, but he can also customize a couple other papers, the Gaurdian and NYT using their APIs. He can also include json data and any rss feed. It would rock if this guy could get search results from each of those sources all at the same time, but I heard he's just a student in a 12 week course, so I'll just call that a bonus feature. Still, I hope that I'll at least be able to search the news sites one by one. Also, my friends want to be able to do the same when they log in, choosing sources and seeing feeds based on their chocices once logged in. They could see their own feedly feed, based on their feedly account if they have one, and they could add other rss, Guardian, NYT, and json files to their feeds.

_Super Bonus User_

The above wireframe is a simple newsfeed. It's meant to focus on the news. I'm the super bonus user, and I'm demanding. This is if Ramzi learns how to code really fast. While the non-bonus site should link to articles, I would be psyched if I could move and resize each of the news sources to fit my super annoying bonus demands. There could even be maximize buttons that allow users to focus on a single source and perhaps an article without leaving the page or going to the original site (this will largely depend on the allowance of the apis/rss feeds).

_Realistic User_

I'm like Ramzi, and I know as well as he does that he has a lot to learn before being too ambitious. He's obviously going to keep this on his portfolio, and he knows that he can improve it in the future. He's always wanted to make this, so I'm sure it will be a work in progress when he has spare time. 

While he'll probably ruin his long weekend because his sadistic instructors rescheduled the project for the holiday, I know what the most important features that he should focus on are (I'm passive aggressive like Ramzi, too). First, I want him to figure out what the feedly api can actually do. If he can effectively use that, then that alone should be sufficient because it should be able to capture most news sources. Alternatively, I would like him to use the Guardian and the NYT, together, or just one. Just one means he really struggled with the APIs.  

Finally, other users should be able to log in and customize their news and news sources.
